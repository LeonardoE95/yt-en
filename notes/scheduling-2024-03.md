# Scheduling 2024-03

Hi!

In here you can find the future videos I plan to make on the channel. Since in the future I might change scheduling, every scheduling file will have a date associated with it. This is the scheduling developed on March 2024.

Remember that while in here I will only write about the videos I'm sure I want to make, every now and then I might get inspired and make a video about a completely different topic.

In the following months my focus will be spread over four main series, each of which tackles a big area of study in the context of penetration testing and security research. These areas are:

- Web Exploitation
- Linux
- Windows
- Active Directory

## Web Exploitation

First of all, I will finish the Web Exploitation series. While I do not have the time nor energy to cover all possible vulnerabilities, I plan to finish the series to give an OSCP-like level of expertises. That is, my objective is to cover all the core web vulnerabilities that you typically find in an OSCP exam.

Here the list of videos:

- [X] Introduction to Web Exploitation
- [X] Getting used to burpsuite
- [X] SQL Injection
- [X] Directory Traversal
- [X] File Inclusion
- [ ] File Upload
- [ ] OS Command Injection
- [ ] Cross-Site Scripting

As you can see, some videos are already done, while some others I will record and publish in the following weeks.

## Linux

The second series I want to start and finish will instead be related
to the world of Linux. The objective is to give an overview of Linux,
how it works, and the main techniques we can use for privilege
escalation. The complexity level reached at the end will once again be
OSCP-like.

Here the list of videos:

- [ ] Introduction to Linux
- [ ] Some Intuition on the Command Line
- [ ] System Enumeration
- [ ] Cronjob Enumeration
- [X] PATH Hijacking
- [ ] SUID Exploitation
- [ ] SUDO Exploitation
- [ ] Wildcard Expansion Attacks
- [ ] Some Intuition on Buffer Overflows

Here the list of videos:

## Windows

Continuing, after Linux I plan to tackle Windows. It will be similar to the Linux series, but this time the focus will be on Windows specific enumeration and exploitation techniques. Once again, expect a complexity level OSCP-like.

- [ ] Introduction to Windows
- [ ] Windows Shells
- [ ] System Enumeration
- [ ] SeImpersonatePrivilege Exploitation
- [ ] Service Hijacking Exploitation
- [ ] Unoquoted Service Paths Exploitation

## Active Directory

Finally, the last planned series (for now) will focus on Active Directory. 

- [ ] Introduction to Active Directory
- [ ] Enumeration
- [ ] AD Tooling
- [ ] NTLM Authentication
- [ ] Kerberos Authentication
- [ ] Kerberoasting
- [ ] AS-REP Roasting
- [ ] DCsync Attack
- [ ] Mimikatz

## And in the Future?

Even after I will be done with all these videos, there will be much more to cover. In particular, I could be interested in covering (at least) these areas:

- Linux Kernel Internals
- More Complex Web Exploitation 
- Android
