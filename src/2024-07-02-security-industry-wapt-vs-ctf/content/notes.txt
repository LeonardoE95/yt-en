1 Capture The Flag (CTF)
========================

  Some characteristics of CTFs:

  - Focus on specific challenges.

  - Each challenge typically has one or two ways to be solved.

  - Can concatenate multiple challenges in a linear path (boot2root).

  - Writeup is mostly linear.

  - Can implement situations you will not find in the real world.

  - Does not assess security risk of a given application.

  - Code is written by other security researchers and CTF players.

  - Useful for studying, practice and having fun.


2 Web Application Penetration Test (WAPT)
=========================================

  Some characteristics of WAPTs:

  - Focus on a specific scope.

  - Scope is made up of a list of hosts, each of which can implement one
    or more web applications and/or services exposed through web
    technology (HTTP, Websocket)

  - All vulnerabilities must be reported. Non linear scenario.

  - Much more structured and complex report.

  - The objective of a WAPT is to assess the overall security risk of an
    application based on a given *threat model*.

  - Code is written by developers which might not be aware of security
    concepts.

  - Useful for decreasing risk of web applications, which in turn
    produces value to companies and developers.

  - Vulnerabilities are less sophisticated, but technology is typically
    more complex (production code is never easy).
