1 Sponsorships can be Useful
============================

  There are various reasons as to why sponsorships can be useful:

  - They allow to make a project more susteniable from an economic point
    of view (not only money, also resources).

  - The previous point is even more critical for projects that do not
    want to attract a mainstream audience.

  - They can showcase useful products/services for people that actually
    need them.


2 Sponsorships can (also) be Dangerous
======================================

  There are also many reasons as to why sponsorships can also be
  dangerous:

  - If done acritically, low quality services/products can be showcased.

  - Even worse, a bad sponsorship might create a fake need just to sell
    the service/product in question.

  - Doing bad sponsorship can decrease trust and reputation on who is
    doing the sponsorship. After all, why trust someone who wants to
    ultimately just sell something?

  - A bad sponsorship can increase the economical strength of
    products/services of dubious value.


3 Hexdump's Criteria for selecting Sponsorships
===============================================

  In my channels Hexdump/esadecimale, a sponsorship, to be accepted,
  must respect the following criteria:

  - It is a product/service of which I can, critically, argument its
    added value.

  - It is a product/service that I currently use or that I used in the
    past.

  - It is a product/service with an economical cost that "makes sense"
    with respect to what it offers.
