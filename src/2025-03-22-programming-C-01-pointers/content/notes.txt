1 On Memory
===========

  To properly understand `pointers in C' it is foundamental to
  understand the basics of memory in modern operating system.

  Specifically, let us consider the following questions:

  1. What is memory?
  2. How is memory structured?
  3. What's the difference between a value and an address?


1.1 What is Memory?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  You can think of memory as a place in your computer where you can
  store `bytes'. That is, memory is made up of `slots', and in each
  `slot' you can write an arbitrary `byte'.

  Remember that a `byte' is made up of `8 bits'.  Thus, in a byte we can
  represent `256 values', from 0 to 255.

  ,----
  | 00000000  -> 0
  | 00000001  -> 1
  | 00000010  -> 2
  | 00000011  -> 3
  | ...
  | 01000011  -> 67
  | 01000100  -> 68
  | 01000101  -> 69
  | 01000110  -> 70
  | 01000111  -> 71
  | 01001000  -> 72
  | ...
  | 11111111  -> 255
  `----

  So, memory is a container of bytes.  These can be called in different
  ways:

  - cell
  - slot
  - location


1.2 How is Memory Structured?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Now, whats the cool thing about memory?

  The cool thing about memory is that we can specify `where' to store
  our values. That is, values don't just exist in random positions of
  the memory. They exist in specific positions of the memory. I can have
  a specific byte as the first cell, then another byte in the 250th cell
  and so on.

  Imagine the following table.

  ---------------------
   *Address*   *Value* 
  ---------------------
           0  01000100 
           1  00000011 
           2  00000000 
           3  00000000 
           4  11111111 
           5  01000110 
           6  01001000 
         ...       ... 
                     
  ---------------------

  As you can see, in every row of the table we have two kinds of
  information:

  - The `address', which represents the specific location in memory
    we're referencing.

  - The `value', which represents the content of the memory in that
    specific `address'.

  Memory is simple like this: it is a very big table of bytes, and we
  can reference each byte by specifying the address itself.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  When you deal with addresses, you often see values like the following

  ,----
  | 0x7fff82e11160 
  `----

  Now, why do we use hexadecimal notation when describing memory
  addresses and not simply decimal?

  ,----
  | 0x7fff82e11160 -> 140735389176160
  `----

  Two reasons:

  - The size of the memory in modern computer is quite big, and
    hexadecimal allows us to describe big numbers with few digits.

  - Hexadecimal notation allows us to quickly understand if a given
    memory address is aligned with respect to a certain number of bit,
    because 16 is a multiple of 2.


1.3 Disclaimer: Stuff is way more complex than this!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  While the idea of imagining memory as a big table of bytes is a good
  first intuition for understanding `pointers in C', the way memory is
  actually implemented in modern operating system is complex and
  requires more concepts to be understood.

  Some key points to consider:

  - `Virtual Memory'

    When a C program interacts with memory addresses, it does not
    actually see the `physical addresses' that are being used by the CPU
    to access the RAM, but rather `virtual addresses'.

    Using virtual addresses allows different program to share the same
    address values, even though in the underlying physical memory they
    actually use different addresses.

    This is a very good abstraction offered by the hardware architecture
    and supported by the operating system.

  - `Page Tables'

    The process to translate a virtual address into a physical address
    goes through specific data structures known as `page tables'.

  - `Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)'

    To speed up the translation process (virtual -> physical), modern
    processors hold special memory regions called `TLBs' that act as
    memory caches to store recent address translations.

  This is to say:

  ,----
  | Thinking of memory as a big table made up of addresses and values is
  | an abstraction that is implemented by the operating system and
  | supported by the hardware architecture.
  | 
  | For the C program, memory is a big table. Which means that to actually
  | understand pointers in C, you can just use the big table
  | idea. However, as you dig deeper into systems, you will need to
  | understand other concepts as well.
  `----


1.4 Sometimes it takes more than 1 byte!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Most of the data types are bigger than 1 byte. Consider for example an
  `int', which represents a normal signed integer. In most architecture
  this data type is made up of `4 bytes'.

  When we have a data type longer than 1 byte, we can still store its
  value. We just have to be careful and use 4 adjacent cells of memory.

  For example, we can store the integer `0xdeadbeef' with the following
  four different cells, where each cell is responsible for storing a
  single byte.

        A big-endian system stores the most significant byte of a
        word at the smallest memory address and the least
        significant byte at the largest.

        A little-endian system, in contrast, stores the
        least-significant byte at the smallest address.

  --------------------
   *Address*  *Value* 
  --------------------
           1     0xde 
           2     0xad 
           3     0xbe 
           4     0xef 
  --------------------

  Thus, it does not matter how big are data types.

  *We can store any data type by using adjacent sequence of single byte
   cells!*


1.5 On the Differences between Values and Addresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  At this point you might think that `values' and `addresses' are two
  completely different things. And in part, that is true: they do mean
  different things!

  However, the cool thing about Computer Science is that underneath it
  all we just have sequences of bits. That is, both `values' and
  `addresses' can be represented using the same methods:

  - binary notation
  - decimal notation
  - hexadecimal notation

  This, in turn, means that an `address' can be stored as a normal
  `value' in memory. After all, the memory just contains bits!  And
  those bits can also refer to other addresses in the same memory!

  This point is critical to understand:

  - Memory is made up of cells.
  - Each cell has an address and a value.
  - The address is a number, while the value is a sequence of bits.
  - Since numbers can be represented as sequence of bits, addresses too
    can be sequences of bits.
  - Thus, memory addresses can be values stored in memory.

  And this is exactly what a `pointer' is!

  ,----
  | A pointer is a place in the memory of a computer program that stores a memory address
  `----


2 Pointers in C
===============

  Let's start with a simple example
  ,----
  | #include <stdio.h>
  | 
  | int main(void) {
  |   int a = 1337;
  |   printf("%d\n", a);
  | 
  |   return 0;
  | }
  `----

  ,----
  | gcc -ggdb simple.c -o simple
  `----

  And we can start asking the following questions:

  1. Where is the variable `a' stored?
  2. How big is the variable `a'?
  3. Let's analyze with GDB the memory used to store `a'!

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Let's see basic operations with pointers:

  - Define a pointer type
    ,----
    | int* pa;
    | float* pf;
    | char* pc;
    `----

  - Extract the address of a variable and assign it to the pointer
    ,----
    | pa = &a;
    | pf = &f;
    | pc = &c;
    | 
    | printf("0x%x\n", pa);
    | printf("0x%x\n", pf);
    | printf("0x%x\n", pc);
    `----

  - De-reference the pointer and access the pointed value
    ,----
    | int a2 = *pa;
    | float f2 = *pf;
    | char c2 = *pc;
    `----


3 Why is C not Memory Safe?
===========================

  By using the pointer syntax, C allows you to access in read and write
  mode every portion of the program's memory.

  This is an extremely powerful abiltiy. However, with power, also comes
  dangerous effects. Specifically, in the context of C, we're talking
  about `memory corruption vulnerabilities', which happens when the
  program C does not properly handle the management of memory, ending up
  corrupting internal states.

  A simple vulnerable program

  ,----
  | #include <stdio.h>
  | #include <stdlib.h>
  | #include <string.h>
  | 
  | void vulnerable(char *input) {
  |   char buffer[512];
  |   strcpy(buffer,input);  
  | }
  | 
  | void main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  |   if (argc > 1) {
  |     vulnerable(argv[1]);
  |   }  
  | }
  `----

  ,----
  | gcc -g -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -m32 vulnerable.c -o vulnerable
  `----

  ,----
  | $ ./vulnerable AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
  | Segmentation fault
