1 Whoami
========

  I'm Leonardo, a *Computer Scientist* with a deep fascination for
  *computational processes*.

  <./img/lisp-logo.png>

  I belong to the following categories of `living beings'

  ,----
  | Human
  | Teacher
  | Computer Scientist
  | Cybersecurity Consultant and Trainer
  `----


2 My Journey (So Far)
=====================

  Before university, I never really studied.  I played a lot of games.
  Mostly stayed on my own.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  I discovered *theoretical computer science* and *mathematics* while
  studying for university between the years 2016-2022.

  The subject just captured me.

  Somehow, it managed to evoke a really deep fascination.

  My academic journey

  - Bachelor's Degree (Rome, Tor Vergata)
  - Master's Degree (Rome, Tor Vergata)
  - PhD attempt (only 1 year then quit) (Rome, Tor Vergata)

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  In the last year of my bachelor (2018), I also discovered
  *Cybersecurity* by following a course named VDSI

  ,----
  | VDSI -> Vulnerabilit√† e Difesa dei Sistemi Internet
  `----

  I fell in love with the subject because

  *Cybersecurity forces you to understand how technology truly works
   under the hood*

  I believe that to protect something we must learn how it can be
  attacked. And this applies to everything in life, not only digital
  systems.

  During this period I've also discovered *Emacs*, the general-purpose
  text processor that I use for most of my tasks.

  It is a tool of fascination, that has challenged my undestanding of
  technology many times.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  After I finished my master's I started a PhD with the idea of studying
  Applied Cryptography. I quit after 1 year, realizing that italian
  academia is not the best place for me.

  Still, the experience was meaningful on its own. I was allowed to
  teach some classes at university and I learned how to read scientific
  research.


3 Work
======

  Currently I'm working as a *software security consultant and trainer*.

  My daily work involves the following activities

  - *Web Application Penetration Test* (WAPT)

  - *Mobile Application Penetration Test* (WAPT)

  - *Secure Code Review* (SCR)

  - *Training Activities*

  - *Threat Modeling*

  - *Development of Security-oriented tooling*


4 Teaching
==========

  After work, I work hard to create educational content focusing on

  - Cybersecurity
  - Programming
  - Computer Science

  My plan is to *master the art of teaching*.

  My approach to teaching is pragmatic, and in all my lecture I always
  focus on finding a good trade-off between:

  - big-picture ideas
  - in-depth technical details

  My ultimate belief is that topics, by themselves, are not
  confusing. Explanations are confusing. I work to explore and construct
  the best explanation possible for understanding each topic.

  Example of series that I've finished:
  - [OSCP Guide]
  - [Practical Web Exploitation]
  - [Linux Privilege Escalation]
  - [Windows Privilege Escalation]

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  The focus in my video is never the `entertainment' in and of itself.

  I make videos to `teach' about the ideas that I find interesting and
  powerful.

  In my videos I hope to convey what it means to become an `expert' in
  these interesting yet complex fields.
